Using reconcile-csv to reconcile OpenRefine data from local CSV files
=======================================================================

This repository contains instructions and example files for using the [reconcile-csv](http://okfnlabs.org/reconcile-csv/) software to reconcile OpenRefine records against a local spreadsheet. This method can be used during data cleanup to match unique identifiers to records based on fuzzy matching and/or multiple criteria fields.

Example data files
-------------------

- **records.csv**: contain sample record data

- **species.csv**: contain sample species taxonomic data
